3. Once You are done with the feature, tested it to make sure it works
4. Create a Pull request
5. Notify others so they can review changes
6. Once Approved Merge your Pull request
7. Delete the old branch, now your features are added to the main project.
8. When others ask for review, make sure to go over their changes (ideally together), and test the feature. Don't approve without making sure the changes aren't messing up the project.
